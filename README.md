# Data Science Projects: Sentiment Analysis & Fake News Detection

This repository contains the code and documentation for two impactful Data Science projects completed during my internship at CodeClause. The projects focused on Sentiment Analysis and Fake News Detection, utilizing datasets sourced from Kaggle.

Project Overview:

    Sentiment Analysis:
        Conducted comprehensive data cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
        Implemented Text Preprocessing using TF-IDF methodology.
        Developed and evaluated Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.
        Comparative analysis of model accuracy.

    Fake News Detection:
        Similar approach to data cleaning, EDA, and text preprocessing.
        Utilized Random Forest and Logistic Regression models.
        Evaluated and compared the effectiveness of both models.

Key Features:

    Thorough data preprocessing and cleaning techniques.
    Implementation of TF-IDF for text preprocessing.
    Development and evaluation of multiple machine learning models.
    Comparative analysis of model performance.
